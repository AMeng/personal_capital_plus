| Hide zero balance accounts    | Hides all accounts from the sidebar with a balance of exactly $0.00. |
| Sort accounts by value        | Sort accounts in the sidebar descending by dollar value (credit cards are sorted ascending). |
| Condense accounts list        | Show more accounts in the sidebar at once by making the display boxes smaller. |
| Hide account changes          | Hide the account value changes in the sidebar and the up and down arrows. |
| Hide net worth                | Hide the net worth field unless hovered on. Hover over net worth to see original value. |
