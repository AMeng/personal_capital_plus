# Personal Capital Plus

A browser extension for [Empower Personal Dashboard](https://home.personalcapital.com)
(also known as Personal Capital). Allows you to customize the UI with these options:

| Option                        | Description |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| Hide zero balance accounts    | Hides all accounts from the sidebar with a balance of exactly $0.00. |
| Sort accounts by value        | Sort accounts in the sidebar descending by dollar value (credit cards are sorted ascending). |
| Condense accounts list        | Show more accounts in the sidebar at once by making the display boxes smaller. |
| Hide header background graphs | Hide the graphs behind the account type headers in the sidebar. This makes the headings easier to read. |
| Hide net worth                | Hide the net worth field unless hovered on. Useful for keeping sensitive info from prying eyes. Hover over net worth to see original value. |
| Replace manual entry text     | Replace the "Manual Entry" text with the current date for each manual account in the sidebar. This makes the last updated account times easier to read. |
